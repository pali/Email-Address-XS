Email-Address-XS
================

This module implements RFC 5322 parser and formatter of email addresses
and groups. It parses an input string from email headers which contain
a list of email addresses or a groups of email addresses (like From,
To, Cc, Bcc, Reply-To, Sender, ...). Also it can generate a string
value for those headers from a list of email addresses objects.
Module is backward compatible with RFC 2822 and RFC 822.

Parser and formatter functionality is implemented in XS and uses
shared code from Dovecot IMAP server.

It is a drop-in replacement for the Email::Address module which has
several security issues. E.g. issue CVE-2015-7686 (Algorithmic
complexity vulnerability) which allows remote attackers to cause
denial of service, is still present in Email::Address version 1.908.

Email::Address::XS module was created to finally fix CVE-2015-7686.

Existing applications that use Email::Address module could be easily
switched to Email::Address::XS module. In most cases only changing
'use Email::Address' to 'use Email::Address::XS' and replacing every
'Email::Address' occurrence with 'Email::Address::XS' is sufficient.

So unlike Email::Address, this module does not use regular expressions
for parsing but instead native XS implementation parses input string
sequentially according to RFC 5322 grammar.

Additionally it has support also for named groups and so can be use
instead of the Email::Address::List module.
